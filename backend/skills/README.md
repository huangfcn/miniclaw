# miniclaw Skills

This skills directory, including its initial structure and content, was originally borrowed from the `nanobot` project. These skills are further adapted from [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)'s skill system.
The skill format and metadata structure follow OpenClaw's conventions to maintain compatibility.

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata)
- Markdown instructions for the agent
